# Hangman
This game was inspired by a contendent of CUNY Hackathon 2021 created by Jason Schwartzman and Efaz Ahmed

After competing in CUNY Hackathon 2021, I was inspired by a team that recreated hangman solely 
from using C++ and print statements in the console.

The game will detect false inputs and will prompt the user if the user wants to play again. The 
program will constantly update the images depending on the amount of strikes the user has.
